**Project Title:** Tech Internship Task - Web Scraping with Selenium, ProxyMesh, and MongoDB Integration

---

**Objective:**

Develop a web application that automates the process of fetching top 5 trending topics from Twitter's homepage, utilizing Selenium for web scraping, ProxyMesh for IP rotation, storing the data in MongoDB, and displaying the results on a simple HTML page.

---

**Scope:**

1. **Web Scraping with Selenium:**
   - Automate logging into Twitter using predefined credentials.
   - Navigate to the homepage and extract the top 5 trending topics from the "Whatâ€™s Happening" section.
   - Use ProxyMesh to ensure each request originates from a new IP address.

2. **Data Storage with MongoDB:**
   - Store the scraped data in a MongoDB collection.
   - Each entry should include a unique ID, names of the top 5 trends, datetime of script completion, and the IP address used.

3. **Web Application with Flask:**
   - Develop a Flask application to serve an HTML page.
   - The page should have a button to trigger the Selenium script execution.
   - Display the scraped data in a specified format upon script completion.

4. **Frontend Design:**
   - Create a simple HTML page with a button to initiate the script.
   - Display the results in a user-friendly format, including the datetime, trending topics, and IP address used.
   - Include a JSON extract of the MongoDB record.

---

**Tools and Technologies:**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Scraping:** Selenium
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Database:** MongoDB (PyMongo)
- **Proxy Service:** ProxyMesh
- **UUID Generation:** uuid module
- **AJAX Requests:** jQuery

---

**Deliverables:**

1. **Selenium Script (`scrape_twitter.py`):**
   - Handles Twitter login, data extraction, and MongoDB insertion.
   - Configured to use ProxyMesh for IP rotation.

2. **Flask Application (`app.py`):**
   - Serves the HTML page and provides an endpoint to execute the Selenium script.
   - Retrieves data from MongoDB and returns it in JSON format.

3. **HTML Page (`templates/index.html`):**
   - Includes a button to trigger script execution.
   - Displays results in the specified format using AJAX requests.

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Instructions for setting up Python environment, installing dependencies, and configuring MongoDB.

---

**Testing and Validation:**

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Ensure each component (Selenium script, Flask app, HTML page) functions independently.
  
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Verify seamless interaction between the Selenium script, Flask backend, and MongoDB.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement try-except blocks and logging for robust error management.

---

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Legal Compliance:**
  - Adhere to Twitter's terms of service and ProxyMesh usage policies.
  
- **Security:**
  - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information; use environment variables or configuration files.
  
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize script execution and ensure it doesn't exceed rate limits or overload servers.

**Conclusion:**

This project requires a systematic approach to integrate web scraping, proxy management, database operations, and web development. By addressing each component methodically and ensuring comprehensive testing, the task can be successfully completed.
